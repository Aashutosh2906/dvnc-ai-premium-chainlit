# Welcome message
welcome_message = """# 🎨 Welcome to DVNC.ai

**Leonardo's Intelligence. Reimagined for the 21st Century.**

I synthesize insights from multiple disciplines just as Leonardo da Vinci did:
- ⚙️ **Physics** - Fluid dynamics, mechanics, structures
- 🦾 **Biomechanics** - Natural movement and force systems  
- 🧬 **Anatomy** - Human proportions and biological design

Share your engineering or design challenge, and I'll help you think like Leonardo!
